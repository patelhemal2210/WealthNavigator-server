Wealth Navigator is an expense tracker and budgeting application. This repository holds server code.

## Monthly expense planner
A monthly expense planner generates expenses that need to be paid every month. eg, mortgage, phone bill, internet bill, utilities, etc.

This is helpful to keep track of all payments that need to be made and the user never misses a single payment.

This expense list contains both manual and automated payments. Automated payments are also tracked to make sure funds are available when the amount will be deducted from your account and thus avoid any low balance penalty.

The user will be notified inside the application to validate the expense transaction and take required action like moving funds, making sure enough funds are available for the transaction.
